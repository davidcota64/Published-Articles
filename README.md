# Published Articles

This repository gathers PDF versions of philosophical articles by **David Cota**.
They explore questions of materialist ontology, emergent complexity, symbolic
inscription, narrative, and the transformation of classical metaphysics in the
context of contemporary science and technology.

## Author

**David Cota** is a Portuguese teacher and philosopher, based in the Azores.
With a background in Biology and Geology and a Master’s degree in Nature
Management and Conservation, he develops a materialist ontology of emerging
complexity that engages with contemporary physics, philosophy of science,
ethics and the transformations brought about by artificial intelligence and
technological systems.

Many of the texts collected here are part of that broader philosophical project.
